Week7: Topic: Vuex StateManagement.

What is Vuex, really?

Vuex is a centralized state management pattern for Vue applications.

Think of Vuex as a single shared storage room 🗄️
All your components can read from it and request changes, but they can’t randomly mess things up.

Why do we even need Vuex?

In small apps:

Components pass data using props

Events bubble up using emit

In medium/large apps, this becomes:

Props drilling 😵

Hard-to-track updates

Bugs from shared data

👉 Vuex solves this by giving one source of truth.
