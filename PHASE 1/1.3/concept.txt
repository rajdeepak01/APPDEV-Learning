1.3 JavaScript: Sync vs Async
CONCEPT: Synchronous = line-by-line execution. Async = "I'll do this later, don't wait."

REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: Synchronous = standing in line at coffee shop. Async = ordering online, doing other things while coffee is made.

MINIMAL CODE:

javascript
// Synchronous
console.log("1. Order coffee");
console.log("2. Wait here");
console.log("3. Get coffee");

// Asynchronous with setTimeout
console.log("1. Order online");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("3. Coffee ready (after 2 seconds)");
}, 2000);
console.log("2. Browse phone while waiting");
